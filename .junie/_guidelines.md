# Guidelines for Junie

**Very important:** strictly follow the rules below:

- Write down the timestamp of the session start (timestamp format: yyyy-MM-dd_hh_mm)
- Before generating any code, always generate a plan-{timestamp}.md file.
- Use the plan-{timestamp}.md file as an input to generate the detailed enumerated task list.
- Store the task list to tasks-{timestamp}.md file
- Do the work that was submitted with the user prompt
- After each task is done, mark it as completed in the task-{timestamp}.md file
